# Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
# should be allowed
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8             # RFC 1918 local private network (LAN)

# Deny access to private IP ranges as destinations (prevent access to internal services)
acl private_dst dst 10.0.0.0/8          # RFC 1918
acl private_dst dst 172.16.0.0/12       # RFC 1918

# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

# Deny access to private IP destinations (internal services)
http_access deny private_dst

# Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

# We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
# web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
# one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
http_access deny to_localhost

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#
http_access allow localnet
http_access allow localhost

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
http_access deny all

# Disable caching (forward proxy only)
cache deny all

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
